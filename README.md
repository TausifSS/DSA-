# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java

## Overview
This repository contains a variety of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAs) using Java, focused on the implementation of the Java Collection Framework. The purpose of this assignment is to apply and demonstrate proficiency in solving common algorithmic problems and basic understanding of basic data structures in Java.

## Features
- **Data Structures:** Use of basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms:** Solutions to common algorithmic problems including sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.
- **Collection Framework:** Java's Collection Framework widely used to optimize data structures and algorithms.
- **Code Readability:** Well-written code with text explaining the rationale and procedure.

## Technology Used
- **Java:** The primary programming language used to implement implementation of DSA.
- **Java Collection Framework:** Used to simplify and optimize the use of data structures.
